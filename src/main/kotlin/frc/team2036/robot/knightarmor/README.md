All Knight-Armor source code belongs in this package.

If you are working on Knight-Armor, ensure that the changes are being made on the Knight-Armor repository and not any repository that was derived off of Knight-Armor (eg. 2018-2019 season code). Also ensure that any Knight-Armor classes are prepended with the word 'Knight' (eg. Robot -> KnightBot).

However, if this is cloned for actual robot code for the season, DO NOT TOUCH THIS CODE UNLESS NECESSARY.
